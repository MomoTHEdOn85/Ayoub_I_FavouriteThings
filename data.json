        "Desc":"Gaming is one of my staple. I do it everyday. My likeness for it first started when I was 7 years old and first started using computer. At that time, we used to play online pirated or emulater games. One of my favourite at that time was Street Fighter. I loved it. Then as I grew up, I discovered more games and played them. At that time most games that I wanted to play, such as GTA Vice City, or Taken, they used to be available for consoles only and I didn't had any consoles at time so I used to buy pirated version of those games. It was like a hit or miss. Sometimes they worked, other times, they didn't. This is how my love games grew more, and now here I am playing or purchasing any games I want."
